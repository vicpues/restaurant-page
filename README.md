# Restaurant page

This is a mock page for a fictional restaurant set in the webcomic [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/story), by Andrew Hussie. It's my entry for the restaurant page assignment in The Odin Project's [Full Stack Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) web dev course.

This assignment was the most fun and the most painful thus far. NPM and webpack are legitimately awesome; so awesome, in fact, that the project started to drag on and on because I kept finding new libraries and languages I wanted to try. Heck, it even got me to try out SASS, even though I called it quits before I really started to dig into it.

That said, configuring webpack is a pain in the you-know-what. It's amazing when you get it right but oh man, it ain't easy getting there without a template. I might look into Vite one of these days to see if it makes things any easier.

On the design side of things, this won't be winning any awards. The charm was in trying to recreate the layout and style of the 2009 original, while trying to make it a little more responsive. I wouldn't hand this to a client, but I like the simplicity, personally. Oh, and writing the text was tons of fun.

In the end, I'm left really wanting to use bundlers more. It's like finding a door to Narnia, so many possibilities.
